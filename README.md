# DBMS-Assignment-4---part-1
Includes the .sql files which were used to create the db for the assignment 4.
Dump20200420.sql file contains all the structures and data in it(Dumped in a Single transaction)
The remaining .sql file contain their respective structures and date in them. 
Use Dump20200420.sql to construct the db.
If using other .sql files, the order of creation is author.sql, paper.sql, reviewer.sql, review.sql and topic.sql

Please don't pay much attention to the populated data. 
In table 'PAPER' column 'ABSTRACT' value 'YES' represents if the author has provided the abstract of the paper in advance.
In most of the other tables, the column calues are just 'Column name + incremented number'.

In screencast recordings, the first video 'creating tables.mp4', depicts how each table created and the constraints associated with that particular table.
The second video 'insert into tables.mp4', depicts 1 or 2 insertions of data into rows.

More data was included into tables after the videos were created.

Dump20200420.sql file was created after more data was added to the db. (I couldn't dump individual .sql files after I re-populated the db. I tried quite a few time but was still unable to do so. However, the structure remained the same.)

Hope this is helpful
